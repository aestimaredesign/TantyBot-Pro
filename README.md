# TantyBot-Pro

A casual yet smart construction cost estimating chatbot, built as a static web app for now. TantyBot helps with cost estimates, price inquiries, and project planning with a friendly vibe.

## Features
- Chat interface for natural conversation
- Cost estimates with material, labor, indirect costs, and contingencies
- Price lookups for common construction items
- Enter key support for sending messages

## Usage
- Visit the live site after deployment.
- Start with "Hi" or ask for an estimate (e.g., "location: Manila", "square footage: 1000").
- Try "price of concrete" or "update with premium materials."

## Deployment
- Enable GitHub Pages in Settings > Pages, selecting the main branch.
- Access at https://<your-username>.github.io/TantyBot-Pro/.

## Future Plans
- Add Next.js for a dynamic UI.
- Integrate FastAPI for an Estimator Agent with tools (Document Parser, Cost DB, etc.).
- Include a data layer with Vector DB and SQL DB.
